Congratulations!

You’ve created a `Whatsapp` app!

Thanks a lot to [Idan Wender](https://github.com/idanwe/), [Dotan Simha](https://github.com/dotansimha) and [Eytan Manor](https://github.com/Urigo) who helped me ([Urigo](https://github.com/urigo)) a lot with this post.

Please also check out the `Meteor` version of the same blog which also includes adding a profile picture and send a picture in the chat.

Compare the two solutions yourself and choose what’s best for you.

You are welcome to add more features and extend this tutorial by pull requesting [this repository](https://github.com/Urigo/Ionic-MeteorCLI-WhatsApp).

Creating a full stack real time mobile app has never been so fast and easy.

And the most important thing - the tools we used (`Meteor`, `Ionic`) are good not only for simple use cases but also for a full production scale apps.

You can safely start with those solutions knowing that you won't have to switch to different solutions when your app will scale and add features.

Next steps:

* If you'd like to deploy this app to a production server, we recommend you check out Meteor Galaxy, the cloud service for [https://www.meteor.com/hosting](hosting and managing Meteor apps).
* Check out [https://www.meteor.com/](https://www.meteor.com/) for many more resources
